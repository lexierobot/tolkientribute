            <h3>A very short, brief, small, little, <br>miniscule timeline of Tolkien's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1892</strong> - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien is born January 3 in Bloemfontein, Orange Free State <em>(now part of South Africa).</em></li>

                <li><strong>1911</strong> - Tolkien begins studying at Oxford.</li>

                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Tolkien writes his first identifiable “Middle-earth” fragment <em>The Voyage of Éarendel the Evening Star</em>.</li>

                <li><strong>1916</strong> - Tolkien marries Edith Bratt, a woman he met while lodging with a Mrs. Faulkner at Duchess Road following the death of his parents.</li>

                <li><strong>1918</strong> - Tolkien served in the British Army during World War I. But when he came down with “trench fever,” he was taken out of the action before his battalion went into battle on May 27, 1918 — a terrible battle where nearly all of the battalion's men were killed or taken prisoner.</li>

                <li><strong>1925</strong> - Tolkien takes up an appointment as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford. He purchases a house in Oxford.</li>

                <li><strong>1926</strong> - First known meeting between C.S. Lewis and Tolkien, and they soon become friends.</li>

                <li><strong>1930</strong> - About this time, Tolkien may have written the first sentence of <em>The Hobbit: “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit“</em>.</li>

                <li><strong>1937</strong> - <em>The Hobbit</em> is published. Because of its success, Stanley Unwin subsequently urges Tolkien to write a sequel, which he begins. This is the germ of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</li>

                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Tolkien becomes Oxford’s Merton Professor of English Language and Literature.</li>

                <li><strong>1954</strong> - Publication of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> on July 29.</li>
